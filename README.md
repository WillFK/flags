Playground for some experimentations with Android.

I plan to use GraphQl, MVI, Coroutines, Koin (or Dagger2 as a fallback), Jetpack's Navigation.
While implementing this project, I may add or change technologies/techniques.

Regarding the data, I shall fetch it from [Countries V2](https://countries-274616.ew.r.appspot.com/).
